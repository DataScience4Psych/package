### Branching and Versioning System

The development of DS4P follows a [GitFlow branching
strategy](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automation/version-control/advanced-git/git-branching-strategies/):

- **Feature Branches**: All major changes and new features should be
  developed on separate branches created from the dev_main branch. Name
  these branches according to the feature or change they are meant to
  address.
- **Development Branches**: Our approach includes two development
  branches, each serving distinct roles:
  - **`dev_main`**: This branch is the final integration stage before
    changes are merged into the `main` branch. It is considered stable,
    and only well-tested features and updates that are ready for the
    next release cycle are merged here.
  - **`dev`**: This branch serves as a less stable, active development
    environment. Feature branches are merged here. Changes here are more
    fluid and this branch is at a higher risk of breaking.
- **Main Branch** (`main`): The main branch mirrors the stable state of
  the project as seen on CRAN. Only fully tested and approved changes
  from the dev_main branch are merged into main to prepare for a new
  release.
